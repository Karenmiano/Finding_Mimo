## Features

- **Random page generation:** Pages to be displayed have been generated randomly chosen and therefore more or less unique. In addition, pages are not repeated unless the user has exhausted all the content available whereby the cycle starts over.
- **User Account Creation:** This was necessary inorder to keep track of the pages already displayed to users. 
- **Database nature:** There are two base tables, one for users and the other that keeps a record of the files available for display, a many to many relationship then exists between the two in order to keep track of the files already displayed to user.


### Future of Finding Mimo

* **Enable bookmarking** - allow user to save articles they found interesting
